# Sunspot Prediction
A time-series model to predict the sunspot activity.

## Quick Start
just clone the repository and run the jupyter notebook. I recommend running the notebook on colab.

## Dataset
 this dataset from Kaggle, which tracks sunspots on a monthly basis from 1749 until 2018. Sunspots do have seasonal cycles approximately every 11 years.
 
  It's a CSV dataset with the first column being an index, the second being a date in the format year, month, day, and the third being the date of that month that the measurement was taken. It's an average monthly amount that should be at the end of that month.
